Here is a list of thumb rules for using async and await:

1. async functions return a promise.
2. async functions use an implicit Promise to return results. Even if you donâ€™t return a promise explicitly, the async function makes sure that your code is passed through a promise.
3. await blocks the code execution within the async function, of which it (await statement) is a part.
4. There can be multiple await statements within a single async function.
5. When using async await, make sure to use try catch for error handling.
6. If your code contains blocking code it is better to make it an async function. By doing this you are making sure that somebody else can use your function asynchronously.
7. By making async functions out of blocking code, you are enabling the user (who will call your function) to decide on the level of asynchronicity they want.
8. Be extra careful when using await within loops and iterators. You might fall into the trap of writing sequentially executing code when it could have been easily done in parallel.
9. await is always for a single promise. If you want to await multiple promises (run this promise in parallel) create an array of promises and then pass it to the Promise.all function.
10. Promise creation starts the execution of asynchronous functionality.
11. await only blocks the code execution within the async function. It only makes sure that the next line is executed when the promise resolves. So, if an asynchronous activity has already started, await will not have an effect on it.
